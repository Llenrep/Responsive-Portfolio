                <div class="bio"><p>Hello! my name is Pernell! My favorite things to do are coding and making music. I first got into
                        as a middle schooler playing the trumpet and eventually it turned into a want to produce music.
                        I guess I suddenly just wanted to attempt putting things together and so far it has been a strong 7 (going on 8 years)!<br>
                        
                        <p>My interest in coding came from the music which is why I mentioned it first. As I got more into it, it required more and
                        and more power which forced me to learn about computers and little did I realize, it was very interesting. What started off
                        as just normal hardware knowledge slowly developed into software and soon after, I began to expand my knowledge on programs
                        and websites as well as how they were made and what tools are necessary to do so.</p>
